# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small!

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, make sure you have the correct version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. See the [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) file for the version used in this project.

Use Yarn Classic (1.x). Run `yarn` in the root directory to install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Make sure your code passes TypeScript:

```sh
yarn typecheck
```

To check for linting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint --fix
```



### Publishing to npm

We use [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to make it easier to publish new versions. It handles common tasks like bumping version based on semver, creating tags and releases etc.

To publish new versions, run the following:

```sh
yarn release
```


### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn`: setup project by installing dependencies.
- `yarn typecheck`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `yarn lint`: lint files with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.

- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
